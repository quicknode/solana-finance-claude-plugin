![Quicknode Solana Finance Claude Skill](assets/banner.png)

Develop financial products as Solana Programs in Anchor 1, 2 or Quasar. The companion plugin to the book [*Building Financial Software on Solana*](https://solanabook.org), with a focus on:

- Accuracy, consistency and security for financial software
- Maintainability, readability, and minimal code
- Current best practices including Rust/LiteSVM for testing

This plugin has the **most stars of any ecosystem Solana Claude plugin** and is based on production-code used by some of the largest programs on Solana. If you're new to Solana: Solana programs are called 'smart contracts' on older blockchains, that's what this plugin builds.

## What is this?

**Solana Finance** is a Claude Code plugin that bundles the `solana` skill - a reusable instruction set Claude automatically applies when working on Solana code, or that you can invoke manually. Skills are triggered automatically based on context (e.g. opening an Anchor program or a Solana Kit client).

## Installation

### As a plugin (recommended)

Add this repository as a marketplace, then install the plugin from it:

```
/plugin marketplace add quicknode/solana-finance-claude-plugin
/plugin install solana-finance@quicknode
```

### As a standalone skill

You can also install just the skill directly:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/quicknode/solana-finance-claude-plugin
```

This installs the skill into the current project's `.claude/skills/` directory. Add `-g` to install it for every project, under `~/.claude/skills/`, and `--agent claude-code` if the CLI detects other agents you do not want it installed for.

## Usage

Once installed, the skill automatically applies when Claude Code works on Solana/Anchor/Quasar projects. You can also invoke it manually:

```
/solana-finance:solana
```

(When installed as a standalone skill rather than via the plugin, invoke it with `/solana`.)
